# ***🐳 Running with Docker***

Want to test the frontend locally without setting up your environment? Docker's got your back.

## **🔧 Step 1: Build the Docker Image**

Run the following command in the root directory of your project:


>**docker build -t coderco-frontend .**
>- ✅ This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the root directory.
>
>- ✅ It tags the image as coderco-frontend.

## **🚀 Step 2: Run the Docker Container**

Once built, start the app with:

>**docker run -p 3000:3000 coderco-frontend**
>- ✅ This runs the container and maps port 3000 inside the container to port 3000 on your local machine.

## **🌐 Step 3: Access the App**

Once the container is running, open your browser and go to:

>http://localhost:3000
>
>>You should see the CoderCo frontend app running! 🎉

### **✅ Expected Output**

- Terminal output should show the server starting successfully.

- You’ll see logs indicating the app is listening on **port 3000.**

- Your browser or the home page of the app should load without errors.

### **✅ Command Verification**

- Both the **docker build** and **docker run** commands have been tested and verified locally.

- The image builds successfully without errors using the Dockerfile.

- Running the container exposes the app on http://localhost:3000.

- The app loads as expected in the browser.

- Logs confirm the app is up and running inside the container.
